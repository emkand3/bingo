A simple command-line bingo board generator that will generate patterns on a bingo board given the user's input. This project was created in 2020, as one of my first experiences with any coding languages.

When the program runs, the user is prompted with the option to generate a traditional bingo board, or a board with random spaces chosen. There are 15 different layout options for traditional bingo, which are:

- 0: diagonal from top left to bottom right
- 1: diagonal from top right to bottom left
- 2: L-R top row
- 3: L-R 2nd row
- 4: L-R middle row
- 5: L-R 4th row
- 6: L-R bottom row
- 7: T-B left column
- 8: T-B 2nd column
- 9: T-B middle column
- 10: T-B 4th column
- 11: T-B right column
- 12: 4 corners
- 13: X (both diagonals)
- 14: + (middle row/column)

If the user chooses to generate a board with random spaces, they will be prompted to choose a number 1-25. The number chosen will create a random board with x amount of spaces filled in.

This project was originally created to be used in tandem with https://minecraftbingo.com/ as a method of randomly choosing which spaces to go for.
